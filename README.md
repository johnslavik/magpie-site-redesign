# Magpie site redesign preview

Independent design preview for Apache Magpie, hosted at:
https://magpie-site-redesign.cloudflare-unfrosted480.workers.dev

## Run and publish

Use Node 22.12 or newer. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run sync-docs` on a fresh checkout.
Start the preview with `npm run dev`. Run `npm test` and `npm run astro -- check`
for checks. `npm run build` refreshes the upstream docs and builds the site;
`npm run astro -- build` rebuilds an existing docs snapshot.

Deploy the built `dist` directory and Worker with `npx wrangler@4.131.1 deploy`.
Authenticate with your Cloudflare account first. Configuration lives in
`wrangler.jsonc`; there are no production Apache deployment workflows here.

Every Worker response sends `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow, noarchive, nosnippet`.
HTML also includes robots metadata, robots.txt disallows crawling, and the preview
has no sitemap. These controls request exclusion from compliant search engines;
the preview is publicly accessible.

The homepage follows four parts: agent integration, Airflow results, workflow
examples, and documentation. Airflow charts are rendered locally from the supplied
artifact data. Definitions and source discrepancies are documented on the story
page and in `docs/designs/2026-09-22-maintainer-first-redesign.md`.

# Apache Magpie — Website

Landing page and documentation hub for [Apache Magpie](https://github.com/apache/magpie), an AI assistant that helps open-source maintainers handle the repetitive parts of running a project — triage, mentoring, drafting fixes, and security-report handling — so they can focus on the work that needs a human.

> Status: **Apache Top-Level Project**. Project source lives at [apache/magpie](https://github.com/apache/magpie); this repo holds the public website.

## Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|---|---|
| Framework | [Astro 6](https://astro.build) (static output) |
| UI | React 19 + [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com) |
| Animations | [Magic UI](https://magicui.design) (Particles, BorderBeam, BlurFade, TextAnimate, ShimmerButton) via `motion` |
| Icons | [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev) + inline SVG for brand marks |
| Docs | Astro content collections, markdown synced from [apache/magpie/docs](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/docs) |

Zero runtime dependency on closed-source design tooling. All components are owned in-tree.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run sync-docs    # one-time fetch of markdown from apache/magpie
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321
```

Always start the dev server with `npm run dev` — it runs `scripts/dev.sh`, which sets `ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` before launching `astro dev`. Without that, Astro tries to write to its telemetry config dir (e.g. `~/Library/Preferences/astro`) and the dev server fails to start in sandboxed environments. Pass extra flags through, e.g. `npm run dev -- --port 3000`.

The `prebuild` hook runs `sync-docs` automatically, so `npm run build` always pulls a fresh copy of docs before generating the static site.

### Available commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server with HMR (telemetry disabled via `scripts/dev.sh`) |
| `npm run sync-docs` | Clone `apache/magpie` (sparse, `docs/` + `images/`) into `src/content/docs/` and `public/docs-assets/` |
| `npm run build` | Static build to `dist/` (runs sync-docs first) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the built site locally |
| `npm run astro` | Astro CLI passthrough |

### Environment variables (optional)

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MAGPIE_DOCS_REPO` | `https://github.com/apache/magpie.git` | Source repo for markdown |
| `MAGPIE_DOCS_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch to sync from |

## Docs pipeline

The website is decoupled from the docs source. The markdown lives in [apache/magpie/docs](https://github.com/apache/magpie/tree/main/docs); this repo fetches it at build time and renders it through Astro content collections.

```
apache/magpie/docs/*.md
        │
        ▼  scripts/sync-docs.sh (sparse clone)
src/content/docs/*.md
        │
        ▼  Astro content collection
dist/docs/**/*.html   (one static page per markdown file)
```

Image references inside markdown (`../../images/foo.png`) are rewritten to `/docs-assets/foo.png` during sync so they resolve against `public/docs-assets/`.

## CI

GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs on every push and PR to `main`:

1. Install dependencies
2. Sync docs from the source repo
3. `astro check` (warn-only)
4. `astro build`
5. On `main`: copy `.asf.yaml` into `dist/` and force-push the build to the `publish` branch

## Deployment

The site is published by **ASF infrastructure**, not GitHub Pages. On every push to `main`, CI builds the static site and force-pushes `dist/` (an orphan, single-commit history) to the **`publish`** branch. The root [`.asf.yaml`](./.asf.yaml) — carried into that branch — tells ASF infra to serve it:

```yaml
publish:
  whoami: publish
```

ASF infra serves the `publish` branch at the project's inferred hostname — `magpie-site` → **[magpie.apache.org](https://magpie.apache.org/)** (served at the apex root). The hostname must **not** be set explicitly via a `hostname:` field; asfyaml forbids naming your own `$project.apache.org` ("it has to be inferred to prevent abuse"), and doing so stops the site from publishing.

The site is built with `base: '/'` so all links and assets resolve against the apex domain. Set `SITE_BASE` / `SITE_URL` to preview under a subpath (e.g. GitHub Pages).

> One-time infra setup (outside this repo): for a brand-new project, ASF Infra may still need to provision DNS/TLS for `magpie.apache.org` before the inferred hostname resolves.

### Previewing a pull request

A committer can publish a live preview of any open pull request by commenting:

    /show-preview

The **Publish PR previews** workflow runs on a 15-minute schedule and then
tracks the PR's head commit — each new push is picked up on the next run —
though GitHub may delay a scheduled run when it is busy. It appears at
`https://magpie-pr<N>.staged.apache.org/`, and like the production site, ASF
staging takes a few minutes to propagate after each publish. A maintainer who
does not want to wait can dispatch the **Publish PR previews** workflow
manually with the PR number.

Previews are retired when the PR closes: the site is replaced with a notice
rather than disappearing, because deleting the branch does not unstage the
site — the branch is only deleted (as a separate, later step) once the notice
is live.

To turn a preview off before the PR closes, delete the `/show-preview`
comment (and, if the preview was started by manual dispatch, also delete the
bot's arming comment); the next scheduled run retires it.

## Agent-assisted contribution (apache-magpie)

This repo adopts the
[`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie) framework via a snapshot
mechanism, making its maintainer-facing agent skills available in harnesses
such as Claude Code.

The framework is **not** vendored — it lives as a gitignored snapshot under
`.apache-magpie/`, fetched on demand from the version pinned in the committed
[`.apache-magpie.lock`](.apache-magpie.lock). The only framework artefact
committed to this repo is the `setup` skill at
[`.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`](.agents/skills/magpie-setup/); everything else
is a gitignored symlink the setup skill wires up.

This site currently wires the framework's always-on **`setup-*`** (secure-agent
setup, status, upstream-fix) and **`list-*`** (skill discovery) families. The
opt-in families (`pr-management`, `security`, `issue`) are not installed; add
them later by re-running `/magpie-setup`.

A fresh clone needs the snapshot populated before any framework skill is
invocable. In your agent harness, run:

    /magpie-setup

(or follow [`.agents/skills/magpie-setup/`](.agents/skills/magpie-setup/)) to
fetch the snapshot per the committed lock, scaffold the gitignored symlinks, and
install the post-checkout hook that re-creates them on each worktree checkout.

Adopter-specific modifications to framework workflows live in
[`.apache-magpie-overrides/`](.apache-magpie-overrides/) (committed) — never
edit the snapshot directly. Framework changes go via PR to
[`apache/magpie`](https://github.com/apache/magpie).
