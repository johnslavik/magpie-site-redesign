# Maintainer-first redesign

A separate design preview for Apache Magpie, built on the existing Astro site.
Preserve documentation sync and project resources. No production publishing.

## Direction

Warm paper, deep ink, Magpie blue. Large, direct typography; generous whitespace;
small radii and quiet rules instead of gradients, glowing surfaces, or decorative
numbering. The existing magpie illustration gives the site a recognisable character.
Blue identifies actions and selected states. The logo remains unchanged.

Lead with the work maintainers want time for. Present concrete workflows, the
Airflow experience, human control, and a short route into installation. Keep
technical depth in documentation. Share header, footer, tokens, and links.
Documentation needs readable line lengths, search, mobile navigation, and an
on-page contents list. Framework docs remain generated, never hand-edited.

## Evidence

User-supplied Jarek Potiuk testimonial: distinguish his 10x volume / 3x speed
assessment from measured security-tracker data. Use an attributed excerpt.

Public source artifacts, inspected September 22, 2026:
- https://claude.ai/artifact/4FJFfDCpzcNPBvJmwWSvFf (monthly)
- https://claude.ai/artifact/DHp5F6ivDMPebBkKMrAAgX (quarterly)

Both generated September 21: 365 all-time trackers, 33 open, 7 open/untriaged,
0.64 hours median triage time. 332 closed is derived as 365 minus 33, and does
not mean 332 confirmed vulnerabilities or fixes. Adoption is marked April 1,
2026; the testimonial's February date describes incoming contribution growth.
Do not label projections as observations or infer causality from these totals.

## Preview hosting

Cloudflare Worker with static assets. Every response carries X-Robots-Tag;
HTML also carries a noindex meta tag. robots.txt disallows all crawling, the
sitemap is disabled, and production analytics are removed. These are indexing
requests, not authentication: the preview remains publicly accessible.

## Refinements after review

Remove promotional eyebrow labels, the trust strip, floating status cards,
repeated positioning, and decorative link arrows across every page. Keep the
bird and quiet motion, with plain headings and direct navigation. Airflow
charts render locally from extracted observed data, with a monthly/quarterly
selector, exact data tables, and sample counts. Do not link to Claude artifacts
from the public UI. Source artifacts remain documented here for provenance.

The lifecycle series disagrees with the cumulative series by three records in
the final open/closed split. Preserve the supplied series, disclose the
discrepancy in that chart, and use cumulative figures for the headline totals.
